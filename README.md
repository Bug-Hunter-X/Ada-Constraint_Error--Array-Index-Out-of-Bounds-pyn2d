# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing an array element outside of its defined bounds.  This leads to a `Constraint_Error` exception being raised.

The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to prevent the error using range checks and proper index handling.
